3D drawings for adapting an S97 2009 Ford Mustang Tremec T5 Transmission to work in a 1967-82 Fiat 124. 

### Files:
```
Bolt a T5 transmssion to Fiat belhousing
Bolt Fiat driveshaft bolt pattern to T5 output flange
Mount transmission in Fiat tunnel
```

## Additional Info: 
This bellhousing adapter assumes you are using a custom input shaft for the T5. In theory the stock T5 input shaft could be used however a clutch with the proper spline count would be needed and the adapter would need to be made thicker. 

Transmission mount uses rubber pieces PN ANCHOR 3270 from a 2018 Cadillac ATS. Mounts from some series of BMW will also work.
