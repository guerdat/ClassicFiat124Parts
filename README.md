# ClassicFiat124Parts
With 3D printers and CNC machines its become affordable to develop and prototype some car parts yourself all thats required is an accurate 3D drawing. I'm setting up this repo as a place to share out any 2D and 3D drawings of parts for the Classic Fiat 124. Hopefully someone will find it useful. 

## T5-Fiat124Adapter
